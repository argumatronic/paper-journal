# Intention

I like to read white papers on paper, so I print them. I write on them and highlight things. I do not like to keep the paper around once I've read it, because who needs this clutter?, but I also don't want to lose the notes and highlights. So, I thought I would start recording my notes and highlights here. Anytime I need to make reference to the paper, it should be easy to look it up again online, cross-reference with these notes, and recall what I read and thought. They may get added to over time as I reinterpret things and learn more. 

Since I also highlight books extensively and might like to keep working notes about some of them, this may over time expand to include notes about books.

# Contributing

I am making this public for now so that people can see what I'm reading and offer feedback/responses to my notes. I will shut it down fast if it becomes an impediment to my or anyone else's learning. But for now feel free to contribute to development by reading the paper yourself and commenting on my notes or contributing any notes you think are important (or offer a different perspective from mine), via issue or pull request. Keep it polite and constructive, please.

# Disclaimer

The fact that I have read and made notes about a paper does not mean I agree with everything the author says or endorse it. Please, if you have a fight to pick with the author of a paper or the perspective of a paper, take that to the author of the paper, not me.
